1. Procedural Thinking<br>

2. Abstract  Thinking<br>

3. Systems Thinking<br>

4. Technological Empathy<br>

5. Debugging<br><br>

<b><p><em>Personal notes:<br></b>

<p><b>The Basics of HTML:</b>
<em>Instructor Steve Huffman, The Reddit guy</em><br></p>
<b>Our Objectives:</b><br>
<em>1. Develop Technological Empathy: Basic understanding of how the internet works.
</em>
Understanding of how users, computers, servers, http, and the internet all fit together.
<br>
<em>2. use HTML tags to create a simple HTML document that a browser can display as a web page
</em><br>

<p><b>The basics of the web notes:</b>

<em>The web, HTML, URLS, HTP, Web Applications</em></p>

<em>+ The worldwide web: collection of html documents</em><br>

<em>+ HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</em><br>

<p><b>Major pieces of the web: </b><em>you -> browser -> internet -> http (protocol) -> servers</em></p>

<b>HTML contains:</b><br> 
<em>+ Text content: what you see</em><br>

<em>+ Markup: what it looks like</em><br>

<em>+ References to other pages</em><br><br>

<p><b><em>From this point on I don't know how to make the code look pretty on the html, I know I can look it up, but I preffer not o cheat and get a deeper understanding</em></b></p>

<p><b>HTML Markup: </b><em>Tags</em></p>

Structure: "<Name> Contents </Name>"

<p><b>HTML Attributes!</b></p>

<br>

<p><em>a void tag is a tag that has no content, so it doesnt need a closing tag)
</em>So how will you ever remember details like this?<p>

Well... you don't have to!. New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts.

But programming doesn't work like that! There's just too many facts to remember them all.

Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them.

<br>

WHITESPACE (<br> inline, <p> block)

<br> break (void)

<p> content </p>

<p><b>Span/div (Container elements)</b></p>

span inline, div block <br>

<em>Review the inline vs block explanation</em><br>

<em>That's right! a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements while div, p, and form are block elements</em><br>

<p>HTML DOCUMENTS<br>

What I've learned:<br>

1. Overview of the Internet <br>
2. Introduction to HTML <br></p>

<p><b>What to take away from this lesson.</b></p>

<p><em>The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:
</em></p>
<em>
1 - What a Web Page is<br>

A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
<br>
<br>
2 - How Coding Works<br>

Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:

I'm <b>learning</b> to code!

look like this:

I'm learning to code!
<br>
<br>
3 - Computers are Stupid<br>

Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").

For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
</b>
<br>
<br>
4 - <b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b> <br>

There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

<br>
<br>
5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary<br>

You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.

Tag:

<br>
<br>
An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<p> for example) and a closing tag, (</p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <br> tag).

<br>
<br>
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

<br>
<br>
Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a>

<h1><b>Stage 1 - Lesson 2</b>: Converting my notes to HTML</h1>
<h2><em>"Curated Path to expertise"</em><br></h2>

<p><em>
+ Allocate 10hours per week, in my case I allocated two 5 hours slots<br>
+ Remener to introduce yourself to the discussion forums<br>
+ shcedule a session with the coach, figure out the google plus thingie
</em></p>

<b>The Stages of Expertise</b><br>
<p><em>

0 Ignorance<br>
(Minutes)<br>
1 Awareness<br>
(Days)<br>
2 Ability<br>
(Years)<br>
3 Fluency<br>

</em></p>

<p>Ability + awareness allows you to make smart decisions<br>
The goal is to get Ability of the top important topics<br>
<br>
When Frustarted or confused, ask for help (google or forum)<br>

The second thing you can do is take a break<br>

<b>The third thing you can do is just keep going!</b><br>
</p>

<b>Looking things up is Authentic: "Looking up things as you need them is a totally normal thing to do"</b><br>

<p><b>General Outline of the course:</b></p>
<p>
See HTML as a Webpage > Work Session 1<br>
See a web page as HTML > Work Session 2<br>
Adding Style; Avoid Repetition with CSS<br>
Make your page look good
</p>
<br>
First Stage: This stage is actually a combination of pieces from two other Udacity classes - Web Development and Introduction to HTML and CSS.

<br>
<b>Stage 1 Summary:</b>
<em>
<p>HTML and CSS are both "languages"<br>
HTML controls the "structure" of a web page<br>
CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).<br>
When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

<b>How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?</b><br>
<p><em>
+ Method 1: write CSS in the <head> of your HTML<br>
+ Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file<br>
+ Method 3(very bad idea): Write your style inline with your HTML<br>
